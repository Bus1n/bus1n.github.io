								exploitation”; or “an act or failure to act which presents an
								imminent risk of serious harm.” Teachers may also be required to
								report suspected abuse or neglect to local authorities, and
								Empowerment Lab expects all teachers to comply with their
								individual reporting responsibilities. Empowerment Lab itself
								may report instances of suspected abuse or neglect as it deems
								appropriate.

						<h2 class="s-text__heading heading">Payment Terms</h2>

						<div class="s-text__text">
							<h3 class="s-text__caption caption">General:</h3>

							<p class="s-text__inner">
								Each Parent agrees to pay all applicable fees for Сourses
								(“Enrollment Fees”) as set forth on the Site. All Enrollment
								Fees are payable in the currency specified on the Site at the
								time of purchase. Parent hereby authorizes Empowerment Lab to
								bill Parent’s payment instrument upon confirmation of a
								purchase, and Parent further agrees to pay any charges so
								incurred. If Parent disputes any charges you must let
								Empowerment Lab know within sixty (30) days after the date that
								Empowerment Lab charges you.
							</p>

							<h3 class="s-text__caption caption">Teacher Payment:</h3>
							<p class="s-text__inner">
								Empowerment Lab will transfer the Enrollment Fees to Teacher’s
								bank account for each sale of a course (or set of courses, as
								applicable) to a Parent within a reasonable period of time,
								minus Empowerment Lab’s service fees (“Empowerment Lab Fee”).
								Empowerment Lab has discretion to act on behalf of the Parent,
								and to not transfer the Enrollment Fees to Teacher, if Parent
								reports that the course were not provided or adequately
								completed. This may include but is not limited to circumstances
								where a Teacher did not arrive for a course or a course was of
								insufficient quality. Empowerment Lab will independently review
								such cases, seeking input from the Parent and/or the Teacher,
								and may decide at its sole discretion to issue a refund to the
								Parent. All determinations of Empowerment Lab with respect to a
								refund shall be final and binding on the Parent and Teacher.
							</p>

							<h3 class="s-text__caption caption">
								Limited Payment Collections Agent: 
							</h3>
							<p class="s-text__inner">
								Each Teacher appoints Empowerment Lab as the Teacher’s limited
								payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the
								Enrollment Fees from Parent. Each User agrees that payment of
								Enrollment Fees by a Parent to Empowerment Lab, as that
								Teacher’s limited payment collection agent, shall be considered
								the same as a payment made directly by such Parent to the
								relevant Teacher and the Teacher will provide the relevant
								Classes to the Parent, as outlined on the Site, as if the
								Teacher had received payment directly. Empowerment Lab, as
								limited payment collection agent for the Teacher, agrees to
								facilitate the payment of any Enrollment Fees (less the
								Empowerment Lab Fee) for Classes pursuant to these Terms of
								Service unless otherwise agreed between Empowerment Lab and the
								Teacher. In the event that Empowerment Lab does not remit such
								amounts, the Teacher will have recourse only against Empowerment
								Lab.
