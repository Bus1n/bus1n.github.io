						<div class="s-text__text">
							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								Empowerment Lab is a service that allows registered parents or

								Courses, and for registered teachers (“Teachers”) to create,
								publicize, and provide those courses (the “Services”). This
								Privacy Statement describes what personal information
								Empowerment Lab collects from registered Parents, Teachers, and
								Learners of the Empowerment Lab, as well as how Empowerment Lab
								collects and uses personal information from visitors to our
								public website and our mobile app (collectively, “Sites”).
								Learners who use the Empowerment Lab Services do so in a learner
								mode called Learner Space which allows us to provide additional
								protections, including for children under the age of 13, as
								described in our Children's Privacy Notice.

								Empowerment Lab collects Personal Data about Children directly
								from Parents and, when we have verified parental consent of
								Parents.
							</p>
							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								Children can only attend Courses or if their Parents enroll
								them. We keep a record of marked and enrolled Courses and may
								infer your child’s interest in topics from these records to
								inform recommendations and Course offerings. Parents provide us
								with the Child’s name and age. Parents may additionally provide
								us with descriptions of the type of schooling their Child
								attends, local time zone, and additional notes for the Teacher.
								In addition, Children may share information about themselves
								during online courses. The Empowerment Lab Courses ake place
								over online videos in which video images and audio of the
								Children are recorded in our systems. We may collect other
								Personal Data about Children in Learner Space, including
								passively collected data, as described in our general Privacy
								Notice, with the exception that we do not collect payment
								information from Children or allow third parties to use Personal
								Data collected through analytics or advertising cookies for
								their own purposes. We also do not condition participation in
								our Services for Children on the collection of more Personal
								Data than is reasonably necessary. Children may also share
								information about themselves during online courses and when
								reporting emergency safety and compliance issues.
							</p>
							<h3 class="s-text__caption caption">Use and Disclosure: </h3>
							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								Once we obtain verified parental consent, we may use and share
								Personal Data collected from Children for many of the same
								purposes described in the general Privacy Notice. We recommend
								Courses and new features to Parents and Children based on
								Childrens’ activities on our Site, such as when they mark
								Courses and if they are using our mobile app or website. We may
								send these messages to Children and Parents through push
								notifications if Parents enable this feature in the mobile app.
								We may also send emails to Parents about those recommendations
								and surveys and informational emails to Parents and Children. We
								do not, however, send promotional emails to Children or allow
								third party analytics or advertising providers to collect
								Personal Data for their own uses through Learner Space.

								Empowerment Lab shares, or allows you to share, the name, age,
								postal address, local time zone, and any notes Parents have
								provided about their Child to the Class Teacher to allow the
								Teacher to provide courses and deliver supplies to Children.
								Children can also privately message Teachers of the Courses
								they’re enrolled in. Parents will get notices of and copies of
								these messages. Children’s video image and voice audio and
								potentially background images of their home and family members
								are shared with the Teacher and the rest of the course as they
								participate in courses. Parents should consider using virtual
								backgrounds for their Children if they have concerns about
								posting images of their home and family members. Children may
								also share information about themselves with the Teacher and the
								rest of their classmates during the course session voluntarily,
								including content, images, and videos they may upload and share
								with their Teacher and classmates. While Empowerment Lab expects
								Teachers and all other Users to abide by our standards of
								conduct and we take reasonable steps to monitor certain
								communications and posts, please note that we are not able to
								control or monitor all Personal Data your Child may share with
								Teachers or other classmates, nor what those third parties
								ultimately do with that information.
							</p>
							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								We urge you to talk to your Children to to also think about
								their own privacy and safety when choosing what to share with
								others. In particular, Children should be encouraged to avoid
								sharing Personal Data like their address or contact information
								with other Children in Courses.
							</p>
							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								At times, we may allow Children and Parents to submit content,
								including photos and artwork, along with other information about
								the Child (like age, first name or initials and city, state, and
								country) that you may allow us to display publicly. Parents
								should review Children’s submissions and avoid uploading any
								private information in the Content about the Children, family
								members, or others. Empowerment Lav is not responsible for what
								other third parties do with information you choose to share
								publicly.

							<h3 class="s-text__caption caption">Class Video Recordings:</h3>
							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								As described above, Empowerment Lab records video of Children

								Empowerment Lab to the Teacher of the class and may be shared by
								the Teacher for the entire class (and their Parents) to view
								(the “Permitted Recipients”).
							</p>

							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								Please note that in some cases, courses are taught by a
								“Teacher” that is actually an organization, group, or team of

								Recordings may be accessed by the entire Teacher Organization,

								individual instructor. Empowerment Lab may share information
								with, and use Class Recordings, to provide feedback to Teachers,
								for customer support, and for compliance purposes.
							</p>

							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								Empowerment Lab will obtain additional parental consent before
								we use any Class Recordings for promotional or other unexpected
								purposes. We request that Teachers refrain from creating copies
								of the Course Recordings or from sharing the Course Recordings
								with anyone aside from Permitted Recipients, and also request
								that Permitted Recipients not download or re-share the course
								Recordings. While we expect Teachers and Permitted Recipients to
								abide by our standards of conduct, please note that we cannot
								control or monitor what such third parties ultimately do with
								Course Recordings.

								Empowerment Lab sends a direct notice with these privacy

								register your Child for and pay for an Empowerment Lab Course.
								If you do not consent or withdraw consent, then we will not
								collect, use, or disclose any Personal Data about your Child,

								Parental Choices and Controls:

								records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or

								collected from Children when it is no longer needed for the
								purpose for which it was collected.

							<p class="s-text__text-inner">
								For users of our mobile app, Parents can choose permissions to
